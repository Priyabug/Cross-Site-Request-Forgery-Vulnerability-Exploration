<h1>Implementation of packet sniffing and spoofing in software</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of this lab environment is to familiarize with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. In a CSRF attack, a victim user, a trusted website, and a malicious site are involved. The victim, who has an active session with a trusted site, visits a malicious site that then sends an unauthorized HTTP request to the trusted site within the victim's session, leading to potential harm.

Here we will carry out a CSRF attack on a social networking application called Elgg, which is an open-source platform pre-installed on our virtual machine. While Elgg includes built-in protections against CSRF, these defenses have been disabled for the purpose of this exercise. This session will cover the following topics:
<ul>
        <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery attack</li>
        <li>CSRF countermeasures: Secret token and Same-site cookie</li>
        <li>HTTP GET and POST requests</li>
        <li>JavaScript and Ajax</li>
</ul>
